  <div class="project">
    <h3>1. Time Series Analysis of Oil and Gas</h3>
    <p>Developed ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast oil and gas prices. Conducted seasonal decomposition, ADF/KPSS testing, and evaluated performance using RMSE and MAE. Delivered insights into future volatility, trends, and energy sector planning. Visualized residuals and forecast accuracy using matplotlib.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>2. Regression Models Benchmarking</h3>
    <p>Benchmarked 20+ regression models including Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, SVR, and XGBoost. Explored diverse datasets such as appliance energy, auto MPG, student grades. Used feature engineering, cross-validation, RMSE, and R² to recommend optimal models. Built notebooks with exploratory and post-modeling visualization.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>3. Candida Auris Infection Prediction</h3>
    <p>Designed machine learning models to assess infection risk in hospitals using patient records. Focused on ICU visits, age, medication, comorbidities. Achieved 88% accuracy using Random Forest. Delivered clinical insights via charts and a healthcare-focused infographic for real-world application.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>4. Brain Tumor Classification</h3>
    <p>Built a CNN using MRI scans to classify brain tumors into glioma, meningioma, and pituitary categories. Applied data augmentation and Grad-CAM visualizations. Achieved >95% accuracy. Optimized architecture using dropout, batch normalization, and learning rate tuning.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>5. Avila Bible Handwriting Classification</h3>
    <p>Predicted medieval monk authorship of scanned Latin manuscripts using Random Forest, KNN, and SVM. Used features like spacing, ink weight, and margins. Best model reached 99.66% accuracy. Applied PCA, DBSCAN, and ensemble techniques. Performed model tuning via grid search and subset selection.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>6. Accidental Drug Deaths in Connecticut</h3>
    <p>Analyzed 10,000+ cases of opioid-related deaths from 2012–2022. Cleaned and engineered features from messy state health data. Built SVM, LDA, and ARIMA models to identify vulnerable demographics. Found peak overdoses in men aged 30–60, with fentanyl as the primary cause. Offered policy-level recommendations and trend visualizations.</p>
